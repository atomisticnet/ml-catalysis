The scripts `01-activation-energy-model.py` and
`02-activity-and-selectivity-model.py` have to be run sequentially.  The
first script predicts transition-state energies based on DFT
thermochemical data.  The second script predicts reforming activities
and selectivities based on the transition-state energies from script 1.

### 01-activation-energy-model.py

    usage: 01-activation-energy-model.py [-h] [dft_data]

    Construct ML Model 1 for predicting transition-state energies from
    thermochemical DFT data and chemical information.

    The model uses a combination of Random Forest Regression and Gaussian
    Process Regression.

    positional arguments:
      dft_data    CSV file with DFT data.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit

### 02-activity-and-selectivity-model.py

    usage: 02-activity-and-selectivity-model.py [-h]
                                                [dft_data] [transition_state_data]
                                                [experimental_data]

    Construct ML Model 2 for predicting catalytic activities and
    selectivities.

    The models are based on linear regression.
